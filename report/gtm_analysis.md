## GTM Insights
### Ideal Customer Profile
- None of the sample market signals fit this category.

### Timing and Expansion
- Revolut keeps expanding into new markets by expanding into new countries and acquiring different companies.
- This showcases that companies that expand can generate a bigger revenue.

### Messaging
- Different partnerships reinforce Revolut's innovation.
- Launching scam prevention reinforces customer trust.

### Financial
- $75B valuation provides credibility from the business perspective.

### Organizational
- Leadership announcements and job openings showcase GTM readiness.
- This can help the company suggest priority regions.

## Recommendations
- Highlight partnerships with known companies and security features could help the company acquire customer trust.
- Focus on Western Europe.
- Showcase financial milestones to show credibility for businesses.
- Prioritise marketing in the new regions(Mexico), to acquire new customers, as Mexico's population does not have familiarity with Revolut.
