# Wavess 2.0 : GTM Intelligence Platform (Task 2)

## Project Overview
This project is a lightweight GTM (Go-To-Market) intelligence prototype.
The goal is to showcase how external market signals from a fintech compay can be collected from public sources, structured and translated into GTM insights.

It is a good choice for a GTM Intelligence Platform because:
- There is a lot of **publically available** external signals.
- The company is constantly expanding into new countries.
- It operates in both consuper and enterprise segments

## What is GTM Intelligence?
In the case of this project GTM Intelligence means using external signals for decisios on:
- Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
- Market timing
- Product-led vs. Sales-led
- Compliance and differentiation

### GTM Categories
Each signal was classified in the categories:

- Organizational

This is explained in 'report/gtm_categories.md'

### Analysis of GTM
- The signals are categorized by the categories and by regions.
- Key findings 
- Recommendations

This is explained in 'report/gtm_analysis.md'

## How to run
- clone the repository
- review the methology 'report/methology.md'
- review the signals 'data/revolut_signals.csv'
- review the gtm categories 'report/gtm_categories.md'
- review the analysis 'report/gtm_analysis.md'


## Notes
- There is no code to clean the data, since during the collection progress the data was presented cleanly.
- This project was made as a task to proceed with an internship application. It was NOT an original idea, however it was made by me.
